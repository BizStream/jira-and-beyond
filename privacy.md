# Privacy Policy

Your data always belongs to you, and only you. Jira to Solo collects minimal data.

## How your data is protected and used

- By default, Jira to Solo does not send any data to our servers or any third parties. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device.
- Once you save your options, they are stored locally by Chrome storage.
- When using Jira to Solo in Chrome or Brave, only atlassian can fetch resources declared in the "web_accessible_resources" section of the manifest.json file. Because of this, atlassian may be able to detect you are using Jira to Solo.
- When a Jira board is open and the button is rendered, Jira to Solo simply listens for a click of the button.
- When you specify a URL to go to, Jira to Solo takes the domain of that URL to grab its favicon in order to display with the button.
- The only things stored locally for you are the URL, favicon URL, button text, and preference on opening the window in a new tab.
